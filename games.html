                        GTA V is a videogame based in Los Angeles all about crime. You can rob various places and setup heists to gain more money.
                        With this money, you can buy more businesses, or buy and customize a huge variety of cars. I love driving and customizing my cars and planes and that is why I love playing this game.

                        Modern Warfare 3 is apart of the Call of Duty franchise, and it is a realistic First Person Shooter game. 
                        The game is fun to play with friends, has some of the most realistic graphics I've seen from a videogame, and is packed with content. 
                        You get a Campaign mode (single player story game), you get Multiplayer (6v6 with gamemodes on variety of maps), Zombies mode (Killing zombies on Warzone Map), and Warzone (100 player battle royale).

                    <p>Fortnite is one of the most iconic games in history, and for good reason. From 2017, its come a long way and set a high standard for gaming. It is one of my favorite games, and I've been playing it since Chapter 1 Season 3. As I've grown up, so has the game with me, and I still remember playing back when I was young. Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite, release updates frequently, and new seasons always have a bunch of new features or items. Fortnite has added new features, such as creator made maps on top of the pre-existing Battle Royale and Save the World game modes. Gaming as a whole would be much different if Fortnite didn't get big, which is why I'm glad it was so popular.</p>

                  <p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a First Person Shooter game all about strategy. It is a 5v5 game where attackers must defuse a bomb and defenders must keep the bombs active. It seems simple, but this game requires a lot of IQ. It is made to be as realistic as possible. There are interactive maps that can be destroyed, you die to one shot if it is in the head, etc. 
                    There are over 60 operators each with different and unique abilities that can be used to aid in defending or breaching the site.
